# Rest countries & open weather Api
+ This task involves creating a web application that fetches data about countries from the REST Countries API and displays them in the form of cards. 
  
+ Each card contains information about a specific country, including its name, flag, population, capital, region, and country code. 
  
+ Additionally, there is a button on each card labeled "Click for Weather," which, when clicked, fetches weather data for the corresponding country using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
  
+ The weather information retrieved includes current humidity, pressure, and temperature. The application utilizes JavaScript's fetch API for making asynchronous requests to the APIs, and event delegation is employed to handle weather button clicks efficiently.
